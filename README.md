# Python Basics – Day 2 (Strings)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my **Day 2 Python practice work**, focused on understanding and working with **strings** in Python.  
The goal of this day was to learn how strings are stored, accessed, and manipulated using built-in methods.


## 📚 Topics Covered
- String basics  
- String indexing  
- String slicing  
- String length using `len()`  
- Common string methods  


## 📝 Tasks Completed

### 1️⃣ String Basics
- Takes a string as input from the user  
- Prints:
  - Length of the string
